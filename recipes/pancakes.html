    <h1>Sheet Pan Buttermilk Pancakes</h1>
    
    <p>
        Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy mornings or breakfast meal prep. The buttermilk makes these baked pancakes light, fluffy, and oh-so-delicious! This sheet pan pancake recipe can be easily customized by adding your favorite fruit or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before cooking.
